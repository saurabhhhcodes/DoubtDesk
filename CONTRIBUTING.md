## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** 18 or higher
- **npm** (bundled with Node.js)
- **Git**

If you plan to run the full application locally, you will also need API keys for [Clerk](https://clerk.com), [Neon](https://neon.tech), and [Groq](https://console.groq.com). See the [README](README.md#environment-variables) for details.

---

## Getting Started

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub.
2. **Clone** your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/DoubtDesk.git
   cd DoubtDesk
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Fill in the API keys as described in the [README](README.md#environment-variables).
5. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Open http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Exploring the Application

Before writing code, it is strongly recommended that you explore the live application to understand how DoubtDesk works end-to-end.

**Live demo:** [doubt-desk-seven.vercel.app](https://doubt-desk-seven.vercel.app/)

**Sample classroom invite code:** `DNOIRL`

Steps:

1. Sign up on the live demo.
2. Complete the onboarding flow.
3. Navigate to Classrooms and join using the invite code `DNOIRL`.
4. Post a doubt, try the AI solver, browse the community board, and check the analytics dashboard.

This hands-on context will make your contributions more informed and effective.

## How to Contribute

### Find an Issue

- Browse the [Issues](https://github.com/knoxiboy/DoubtDesk/issues) tab.
- Filter by labels: `good-first-issue`, `beginner-friendly`, `enhancement`, `bug`.
- **Comment on the issue** to indicate you are working on it, so others do not duplicate effort.

### No Issue Exists?

- If you found a bug or have an idea, **open a new issue first**.
- Describe the problem or feature clearly with steps to reproduce (for bugs) or expected behavior (for features).
- Wait for maintainer approval before starting work on large features.

---

## Development Workflow

```
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch from main
3. Make your changes
4. Test locally (npm run dev)
5. Commit with a clear, conventional message
6. Push to your fork
7. Open a Pull Request against main
```

---

## Branch Naming

Use descriptive, prefixed branch names:

| Prefix      | Use Case                 | Example                                 |
| :---------- | :----------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| `feature/`  | New feature              | `feature/add-search-to-doubts`          |
| `fix/`      | Bug fix                  | `fix/classroom-invite-code-validation`  |
| `docs/`     | Documentation            | `docs/add-screenshots-to-readme`        |
| `style/`    | UI/styling changes       | `style/improve-mobile-sidebar`          |
| `refactor/` | Code refactoring         | `refactor/extract-doubt-card-component` |
| `test/`     | Adding or updating tests | `test/add-doubt-card-unit-tests`        |

---

## Commit Message Format

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard:

```
<type>: <short description>
```

**Types:**

| Type       | When to Use                             |
| :--------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | Adding a new feature                    |
| `fix`      | Fixing a bug                            |
| `docs`     | Documentation changes                   |
| `style`    | UI/CSS changes (no logic change)        |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring (no behavior change) |
| `test`     | Adding or updating tests                |
| `chore`    | Build, config, or tooling changes       |

**Examples:**

```
feat: add loading skeleton to classroom page
fix: prevent duplicate join on invite code submission
docs: update contribution guide with demo classroom
style: fix mobile alignment on doubt cards
refactor: extract moderation logic into shared utility
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure your branch is up to date** with `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   git checkout your-branch
   git rebase main
   ```

2. **Create the PR** against the `main` branch.

3. **PR title** must follow the commit message format:

   ```
   feat: add search functionality to public doubts page
   ```

4. **PR description** must include:
   - A clear summary of what the change does
   - Related issue number (e.g., `Closes #12`)
   - Screenshots (if there are UI changes)

5. **Keep the PR scoped.** Each PR should address one issue or feature. Do not bundle unrelated changes — this is the most common reason PRs are rejected.

6. **Wait for review.** Maintainers will review within 48 hours. Address any feedback by pushing additional commits to the same branch.

## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript

- Avoid `any` types wherever possible. Define proper interfaces for all data structures.
- Use `const` by default; use `let` only when reassignment is needed.
- Never use `var`.

### React / Next.js

- Use functional components with hooks.
- Keep components focused — one component per file.
- Place reusable components in `/components`.
- Place page-specific logic in `/app/<route>/page.tsx`.
- Use `"use client"` directive only when client-side interactivity is required.

### Styling

- Use **Tailwind CSS** exclusively. Do not introduce external CSS files.
- Match the existing dark theme: `slate-950` backgrounds, `blue-500`/`blue-600` accents.
- Maintain glassmorphism patterns where applicable (`backdrop-blur`, `border-white/10`).
- Ensure all UI changes are responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop.

### File Organization

| Type                | Location                          | Example                     |
| :------------------ | :-------------------------------- | :-------------------------- |
| API routes          | `/app/api/<feature>/route.ts`     | `/app/api/doubts/route.ts`  |
| Page components     | `/app/<route>/page.tsx`           | `/app/dashboard/page.tsx`   |
| Reusable components | `/components/<ComponentName>.tsx` | `/components/DoubtCard.tsx` |
| UI primitives       | `/components/ui/<primitive>.tsx`  | `/components/ui/button.tsx` |
| Shared utilities    | `/lib/<utility>.ts`               | `/lib/moderation.ts`        |
| Database schema     | `/configs/schema.ts`              | —                           |
| Database connection | `/configs/db.tsx`                 | —                           |
| Scripts             | `/scripts/<script>.ts`            | `/scripts/seed.ts`          |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

These are the most frequent reasons PRs get rejected or require revision:

1. **Scope creep.** Do not bundle unrelated changes (e.g., adding a footer in a "fix typo" PR). Each PR should address exactly one issue.
2. **Using `any` types.** TypeScript exists for a reason. Define interfaces for all data structures.
3. **Breaking previously merged work.** Always check recent PRs and the current `main` branch before modifying shared components.
4. **Undocumented changes.** If your PR touches infrastructure (database config, dependencies, middleware), document it in the PR description.
5. **Dead links or placeholder content.** Do not add links that point to `#` or placeholder text like `example@placeholder.com`. Either link to real destinations or remove them.
6. **Missing mobile responsiveness.** All UI changes must work on mobile viewports (375px and above).
7. **AI-generated artifacts.** Do not include `<think>` blocks, chain-of-thought outputs, or other AI tool artifacts in PRs or code comments.
